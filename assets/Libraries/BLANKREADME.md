# RRRE - Regroup, Refactor, Regrade Event

## When

- Date: Sunday 10/30
- Time: 10am - 3pm

## What Is It?

We will be hosting an event that connects students who did well on module challenge’s with those who got grades they would like to improve. We will primarily be focusing on homework’s that have already been graded. This focus is so that we can attempt to improve your work based on the graders feedback.

## How do Regrades Work?

You have 4 attempts total on each assignment. As far as we can tell the date you submit does not matter. So, take your time. 

We also believe that the graders are using rubrics from the previous year that have different acceptance criteria. The only way to get those grades corrected is to speak with a TA or John. I highly recommend Seth Wooten specifically for this. 

## How To Contribute

See the contacts below and we will pair you up. Let us know how many people you feel comfortable tutoring. Even if you only want to help tutor 1 person that is fine. 

### Why Should You Contribute

On LinkedIn people can "give kudos" and give "reccomendations". This is a perfect opportunity for people who received help to write a message such as the following.

"< X Person > helped tutor me during a UCF Coding Bootcamp Regroup, Refactor, Regrade Event. Wonderful person and immensely generous to give their time to me during the bootcamp."
